# 123robot Simulator

Welcome! This little project started all of a sudden in a fraction of second :P

**What is 123robot Simulator?**
123robot Simulator is a little game where we simulate the life of 123robot (you will know who this person is soon).
We will be using the irrlicht Graphics engine (http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net) along with Blender 3D (https://www.blender.org/), GIMP (https://www.gimp.org/) and Bullet physics (https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) :D
The game will be written in C# :eyes:

**Who is 123robot?**
A forum user I met on GTAForums. No doubt one of the best persons I have met on the internet. This game will be about this great person, about his little problems (IDAHOS!) and his beeps and boops. :)

*This ReadMe and this project in general is still in its infancy stage. We will update sooner than soon. :P*
